# SOLARA E-Commerce Website Requirements

## Frontend Only - No Backend Dependencies Required

This project is a pure frontend application and does not require any Python packages or backend dependencies.

### Browser Requirements:
- Modern browser with IndexedDB support (Chrome 24+, Firefox 16+, Safari 10+, Edge 12+)
- JavaScript enabled
- Cookies and Local Storage enabled

### Development Server (Optional):
If you want to run a local development server, you can use:

**Python:**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

**Node.js:**
```bash
npx serve .
# or
npm install -g http-server
http-server -p 8000
```

**VS Code:**
- Install "Live Server" extension
- Right-click index.html and select "Open with Live Server"

### Notes on Data Persistence:

**IndexedDB (User Authentication):**
- User accounts are stored in the browser's IndexedDB
- Passwords are hashed with PBKDF2-SHA256 (120,000 iterations)
- Data persists across regular browser sessions
- **Incognito/Private mode**: IndexedDB is isolated per session and cleared when closed
  - This is expected browser behavior for privacy
  - Users must register separately in each incognito window
  - Regular browsing mode persists data normally

**LocalStorage (App Data):**
- Products, cart, wishlist, and orders use localStorage
- Persists across sessions (including incognito until window is closed)
- Clearing browser data will erase all stored information

### Production Considerations:
For production use, consider:
- Backend API with real database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
- Server-side password hashing and JWT authentication
- HTTPS for secure transmission
- Session management with secure cookies
- Data backup and recovery systems
